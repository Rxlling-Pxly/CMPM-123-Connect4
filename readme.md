Files modified besides Connect4.h and Connect4.cpp:

    readme.md
    - so I could write this

    .gitignore
    - so build folder doesn't commit

    CMakeLists.txt
    - so connect 4 files are linked

    ChessSquare.cpp
    - changed doubles to floats, removing warnings

    Applicaton.cpp
    - so you can play connect 4

    Game.cpp
    - so you can see which square you're highlighting
    - so you can set the AI to be either player 1 or 2
